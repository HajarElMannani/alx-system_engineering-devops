Project: 0x14. MySQL
-----------------------------------------
This directory contains the following tasks

Task 0. Install MySQL
First things first, let’s get MySQL installed on both your web-01 and web-02 servers.

Task 1. Let us in!
In order for us to verify that your servers are properly configured, we need you to create a user and password for both MySQL databases which will allow the checker access to them.

Task 2. If only you could see what I've seen with your eyes
In order for you to set up replication, you’ll need to have a database with at least one table and one row in your primary MySQL server (web-01) to replicate from.

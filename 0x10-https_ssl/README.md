Project: 0x10. HTTPS SSL
----------------------------------------
This directory contains the following tasks

Task 0. World wide web
Configure your domain zone so that the subdomain www points to your load-balancer IP (lb-01). Let’s also add other subdomains to make our life easier, and write a Bash script that will display information about subdomains.

Task 1. HAproxy SSL termination
“Terminating SSL on HAproxy” means that HAproxy is configured to handle encrypted traffic, unencrypt it and pass it on to its destination.

Task 2. No loophole in your website traffic
A good habit is to enforce HTTPS traffic so that no unencrypted traffic is possible. Configure HAproxy to automatically redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
